# Driving School - Safe Drive, Safe Life

## Overview

The **Driving School** (Safe Drive, Safe Life) project is a full-stack web application designed to raise awareness about road safety and responsible driving. The app features a responsive image slider, user authentication, and informative sections like About and Contact Us. Built with a modern stack, the frontend utilizes **React** with **Vite**, and the backend is powered by **Node.js** and **Express** (if you have a backend, otherwise you can remove backend references).
